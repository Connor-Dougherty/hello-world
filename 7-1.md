## Primitive Data Types
  #### * Float
  * The float data type in Java is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Itâ€™s mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers.
  #### * Byte
  * The byte data type is used to save memory in large arrays where the memory savings is most required. It saves space because a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. It can also be used in place of "int" data type.
  #### * Double Data Type
  * The double data type is generally used for decimal values just like float. The double data type also should never be used for precise values, such as currency.
  #### * BigInt
  * The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) for Numbers.
  #### * Symbol
  * A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.
  #### * INT
  * The int data type is generally used as a default data type for integral values unless if there is no problem about memory.
  #### * Short Data Type
  * The short data type can also be used to save memory just like byte data type. A short data type is 2 times smaller than an integer.
  #### * Long Data Type
  * The long data type is used when you need a range of values more than those provided by int.
  #### * Null
  * This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.
  #### * Undefined
  * The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined. Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === "object").
  #### * Char
  * The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).The char data type is used to store characters.
  #### * String
  * The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units.
  #### * Number
  * Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.
## My Thoughts 
  #### * What I learned
  * Strings are sequences of characters.
  * Numbers are used to represent numeric values.
  * Booleans are used to represent true or false values.
  * const is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.
  * let is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
  * Primitive data types are immutable.
