## From my perspective
My perspective on the chapter in the book is that, its alot more confusing than what you put in git hub. Its probably cause im heavily a visual learner, but the book just simply doesnt have any videos or enough examples for me to easily understand.
I can tell it has the same stuff as week 10's content, but its just put into a more confusing way. The only thing i can really compare it to is your github page for week 10.
## The code
As for the code the only thing wierd i see in it is the the semicolons on line 8 and 15.
