## What's up with undefined vs null vs 'not defined'?
NULL
Null is a primative data type.  When assigning a "null" value to a variable you are deliberately assigning the value "nothing" to that variable.
UNDEFINED
When a varible is declared without a value the variable is "undefined".  
A varible can only be declared without an initial value using the "let" declaration. 
For instance, declaring a variable as "let someVar;" creates the memory allocation for the variable "someVar" but does not assign a value to that variable, therefore attempts to use someVar results in java script indicating the value is "undefined".
NOT DEFINED
In JavaScript, if attempts are made to reference a variable that has not be declared JavaScript returns the error the variable refernced is “not defined”. 

## How do collection types treat undefined? Heck, what are collection/composite data types?
Collection data types are used to keep track of groups of things. 
They are also known as composite data types. 
The two most common collection data types are arrays and objects. In fact, arrays are just a special type of object.

## When does const not mean constant?
When using "const" to declare a primative data type the value cannot be changed but when "const" is used to declare collection types, such as an array, the values within the array can be manipulated.  An array is a collection, or list of data stored in a memory location referenced by the name assigned to the array when the array is declared.  
The elements, or values, in the array are referenced by index starting with position [0], meaning the first value in the array is stored in position "0" not position "1".  In JavaScript, values are assigned to an array using comma separaters
and can be referenced using the array reference for the value.  For example, an array with 5 elements will have indices from 0 to 4 and the values of each element can be referenced by addressing their position in the array.

## How do we use variables as function arguments? What happens when we pass a variables that's bound to a primitive data type as a function argument?
When a function is created we must define what varibles, or arguments, the function is to be passed.  These argumnets must be passed to the function at the time the function is called. 
We can call functions from the main script and pass arguments to a function so that the arguments can be used within the "scope" of the function.  
Variables declared within a function do not exist outside the function and therefore cannot be refernced out side the function.
For values created or modified within a function to be used outside of the function the value must be passed to a varible that has been declared outside the function and assigned the returned value when the function is called.  

## What's the deal with object literals? How do we reference their properties? What's the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?
Arrays use a numerical value, the location of the element, in the collection to refernece values:
const me = ["Manav", 23];
console.log(me[0]); displays Manav

## Object literals, are indexed collection/composite types that reference elements view strings assigned as property names when the object was created. 
const me = { name: "Manav", age: 23 };
console.log(me.name);  displays Manav

## Dot notation allows us to use the proprty names, for example me.name, and a more meaningful references to access the value within the array.
Bracket notation, references the values in an array by element numberor location in the array, for example me[0].  
An alternate Bracket notation uses the property name value but requires the use of quotation marks in the reference, for exampleme["name"]

## What about function scope? What's the deal with variable shadowing?
Variable shadowing is a process of using variable names for the main script in a function, either within the function itself or in the arguments that are used in the function definition.  Variables within a function should be unique to the function and function arguments
should not have the same name as variables outside the function.
Function scope refers to the code within the bounds of the function.  Functions should be scoped to operate on arguments passed to them and return values that are used in the main script and potentially passed to other functions.
